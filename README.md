# Amazon-Coding-Challenge-June-2022

During the Bright Network Virtual Internship hosted in June 2022, part of the requirements for finishing the internship was to attempt the Amazon coding challenge.
The challenge was to write a python code that allows a particular robot go through a 2D grid from a the starting point <code>[0,0]</code> to the end <code>[9,9]</code>
while avoiding obstables at different locations.
